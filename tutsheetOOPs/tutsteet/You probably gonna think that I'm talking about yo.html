	<font>You probably gonna think that I'm talking about you and you goddamn right I am look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you subliminally, but I think criminal instinct has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink he still loves me cause he puts me in his ink he does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he? Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky and there's no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he? this bitch really thinks she can get me if she still wants me, driving across country strapped him to the front seat, missing all the front teeth thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me? I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once and once she does, she'll be stuffed up in a trunk crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball bunched up nice and comfy fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me you cunning little cunt, deceitful witch you thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this [Hook:] The problem is all inside your head she said to me The answer is easy if you take it logically I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free There must be 50 ways to leave your lover [Verse 2:] I feel like a serial killer I keep dumping bodies in the lake, Imma get caught and sent up the river I shiver when I think of the company I keep how do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep? I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink sex kept us together, when we slept together everything was all better, she made me feel like a king slowly, she began lowering my self- esteem she go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her and I just bought her a truck for 50,</font>

	<font> dollars accused me of doing drugs and screaming "holla" then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana and all I know is every time I go to them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow the little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke that's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago and I wouldn't even let on like I know what was I supposed to do, call her out on it? we just argue say she put it down on purpose and flipped the whole script ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch a cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch she thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this [Hook:] The problem is all inside your head she said to me The answer is easy if you take it logically I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free There must be 50 ways to leave your lover Thanks to Jordan White for adding these lyrics</font>

	<font>Kunal maini is very fond
of playing with
numbers. Once , one of
our professors caught
him while he was
playing with numbers in class and asked him
what he is doing ?
Kunal maini said
“He just found a Zeheri
number : where A is said
to be the zeheri number if 2*A can be formed
permutating the digits
of A”
Example: if A =
</font> 
	<font>497128905</font> 
	<font>, then 2*A =
</font> 
	<font>994257810</font> 
	<font>, which can be formed by
permutating the digits
of A. Now, professor got
angry and punished him.
His punishment was to
tell the number of zeheri
numbers between P and
Q. Now, being the friend of
kunal maini, your task is
to write down a
program to solve his
problem. INPUT:
Each line of input will
contain a tuple (P,Q),
where the last line
should be the tuple (0,0) OUTPUT:
For each line
corresponding to the
input, print the number
of zeheri numbers
between P and Q. CONSTRAINTS:
1 &lt;= P &lt;= Q &lt;=

kurukshetra were at AE
lawns corridors, waiting
for their professor.
AE LAWNS
AE Lawns corridors can be viewed as semi-
infinite ground having
width= 3 units and
starts straight from the
electrical department.
0,3 1,3 2,3 . . . Electrical 0,2 1,2 2,2 . . .
Department 0,1 1,1
2,1 . . .
(0,0) Diagram: AE LAWNS
Length ----> Assume AE lawns like a
Cartesian plane.
Now, as students are
getting bored they
decided to play a game.
Let us call them student1, student2,
student3.
Rules of Game
1) Distance b/w two
students is to be
measured only along the length. Example: the
distance b/w (0,1) and
(10,3) is 10 units.
2) All three student
starts from (0,1), (0,2),
(0,3). 3) If a&lt;b, then student b
can never be to the right
(along length) of student
a.
4) At any point of time
student p and student p +1 should not be
separated by a distance
greater than L.
5) At the end of k moves
they should end up
along the same column. INPUT
One line containing two
integers L and k. where
0&lt;=L&lt;=7; 0&lt;=K&lt;=10^9 OUTPUT
An integer which is the
number of ways in
which the game can be
completed.

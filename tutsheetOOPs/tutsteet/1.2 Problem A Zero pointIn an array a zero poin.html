	<font>1.2 Problem A: Zero point:
In an array a zero point
is defined as the
element, whose both
the neighbour elements
are Larger than it. Example:
</font> 
	<font>1 2 7 4 5 6</font> 
	<font>
Here 4 is the zero point. INPUT:
User will enter the value
of n.
The rest n lines will
follow the n elements of
array. OUTPUT:
print the index of the
zero point. PROBLEM B:
Alice and Bob are playing
a game. The game
consist of two heaps A &amp;
B, containing n1 and n2
objects respectively. The rules of the game are as
follows:
1. Alice starts the game.
2. Both players play
alternately.
3. A player in his turn can pick any number of
objects from one of the
piles or pick 'k' objects
from each of the piles(k
&lt;= minimum of both the
piles). 4. The player picking up
the last object or set of
objects wins Alice and Bob will play
several games. Given n1
and n2, find out who
win the game, Assuming
both players play
optimally. Input: Input will begin with an
integer T, the number of
test cases.
T lines follow. Each test
case contain 2 numbers
n1 and n2. Output For each test case, print
the winner of the game
(in capital letters)
followed by a newline
character. Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^8
0 ≤ N1 ≤ </font>
